This book introduces a framework for habit forming.
Many approaches/tricks are highly practical and easy to follow.

## Core Ideas

### A Four-Step Model of Human Behavior

The process of building a habit can be divided into the following four steps: **cue**, **craving**, **response** and **reward**.

The cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the cravings and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.
If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will *not* become a habit.

Therefore, to form a new good habit or to break an old bad habit, we must work on all four steps:

|     | Cue | Craving | Response | Reward |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Make a good habit | **obvious** | **attractive** | **easy** | **satisfying** |
| Make a bad habit | **invisible** | **unattractive** | **difficult** | **unsatisfying** |

### Make It Obvious

1. Use **implementation intentions**: "I will [do something] at [some time] in [somewhere]".
    + Commit to daily writing hours at a specific time and location.
    {: .notice--primary}

1. Use **habit stacking**: "After a current habit, I will do some new habit".
    + After my morning routine, I'll spend at least an hour writing.
    + After my noon nap, I'll do 10 pushups.
    {: .notice--primary}

1. Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible.
    + Charge my phone at a power outlet far away from my work desk.
    + Tidy-up my working environment so that I can focus solely on the task at hand.
    {: .notice--primary}

### Make It Attractive

1. Use **temptation bundling**. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.
    + I'll watch my favorite TV episodes when walking on the treadmill.
    {: .notice--primary}

1. Join/Create a culture where the desired behavior is the norm.
    + (The close:) Make a living schedule together with my partner and stick to it.
    + (The many:) Create a team culture that values efficient collaboration and communications during working hours.
    + (The powerful).
    {: .notice--primary}

1. Create a **motivation ritual**. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.
    + Make a cup of tea/coffee before starting my work for the day.
    {: .notice--primary}

### Make It Easy

1. Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.
    + Create (keyboard) shortcuts on my laptop that directly link to the current project.
    + Remove shortcut links to websites that may negatively impact work efficiency.
    {: .notice--primary}

1. Prime your environment to make future actions easier.
    + Put exercise clothing at the entrance of the apartment door. Put them on right after getting back from work.
    {: .notice--primary}

1. Harness the *decisive moment*. Optimize the small choices that decides whether your day is productive or not.
    + When having the temptation to do something unproductive, think twice about workday productivity.
    {: .notice--primary}

1. Use the **Two-Minute Rule**. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.
    + Commit to exercise at least 2 minutes per day.
    + Commit to do 30 pushups a day.
    {: .notice--primary}

1. Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behavior.
    + Design a personal productivity system and using an app to track its progress. Review and adjust the system regularly.
    + Use browser plugins to block distractive websites.
    + Do not hesitate to buy something that can boost productivity.
    {: .notice--primary}

### Make It Satisfying

1. Use reinforcement. Give yourself an *immediate reward* (rather than delayed reward) when you complete your habit.
    + After working for a productive day, watch some enjoyable videos/TV episodes/movies.
    + Use an App to-do list. Check the item on the to-do list right after a positive behavior.
    {: .notice--primary}

1. **Never** miss a habit twice in a row.

## Notes & Excerpts

### Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

+ Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. You get what you repeat.
  > That's how knowledge works. It builds up like compound interest." --- Warren Buffett.
+ In order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau---the *Plateau of Latent Potential*.
+ Forget about setting goals. Focus on the system instead.
+ Three level of changes: outcome, process, and identity. The most effective way to change a behavior is to focus on what you wish to become. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
+ The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.

### Cue

+ Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.
+ the process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You must be aware of the habits before you can change them.
+ Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.
+ Gradually, your habits become associated with the entire *context* surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.
+ Spend less time in tempting situations. It is easier to avoid tempations than resist it.

### Craving

+ It is the *anticipation* of a reward---not the fulfillment of it---that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.
+ Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive.

### Response

+ Walk slowly, but never backward.
+ Focus on taking action, not being in motion.
+ The amount of time < the number of times you perform a habit.
+ The *Law of Least Effort*: we will natually gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. Our real motivation is to be *lazy* and to do what is *convenient*.
+ The idea is to make a habit as easy as possible in the moment to do things that *payoff in the long run*.
+ Standardize before you optimize. You cannot improve a habit that does not exist.

### Reward

+ The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: *What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.*
+ One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of *making progress*.
+ Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.

### Advanced Tactics

+ Play a game that favors your strengths. Create a game if it does not exist.
+ Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.
+ The *Goldilocks Rule* states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are *right on the edge* of their current abilities.
+ It is the ability to keep going when work isn't exciting that makes the difference.
+ Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.
+ Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
+ Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.
+ Shape and update your personal identity regularly.
