This page is a curated list of awesome links/presentations that I would like to revisit occasionally.

## About Graduate Study in Computer Science

## Other ''Awesome'' Sharing

## Courses/Materials

Here I list a couple of links to some online courses and course materials that I personally find useful.
I privately keep a mirror of some websites.
The mirrors will be activated in case any link fails.

* [Fault-Tolerant Computer System Design](https://engineering.purdue.edu/FTC/) course material, ECE 60872/CS 59000, Purdue University, instructed by Prof. [Saurabh Bagchi](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sbagchi/).
